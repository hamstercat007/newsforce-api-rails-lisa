      <p>
        Four aspirational students met at a software engineering school in
        London, UK. </p>
        <p>In a world of post-Brexit, Trump's fake news, and Covid
        misinformation, they realised the need for high quality news to educate
        people. </p>
        <p>However, free access to News Apis is under threat. To meet
        rising costs, more news outlets are forced to charge for their News APIs
        usage. </p><p>These students engineered a way to make news from different
        sources freely available to all, to help people be better informed and
        have a broader view. May the Newsforce be with you.
